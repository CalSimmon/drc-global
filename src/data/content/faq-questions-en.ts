    question: "What is DRC token?",
    answer: [
      "DRC is an ERC20 token that was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply of one billion indivisible tokens and a zero inflation rate. DRC is a monetary experiment conducted with the purpose of finding out how the global economic recession and the increasing demand for decentralized financial instruments may affect its global adoption and usage.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How is DRC innovative?",
    answer: [
      "The DRC token distribution model is innovative as there was no token sale. 100% of the token supply was issued at Uniswap decentralized exchange. No tokens were ever premined and no more tokens will ever be minted. The 1,000,000,000 supply of DRC will always remain so; the tokens are indivisible (0 decimals). The project is fully decentralized and managed by the DRC community.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How is the value of the DRC token defined?",
    answer: [
      "The value of the DRC token depends on the network effect and its global adoption. The stable historical performance is needed to prove its potential to become a store of value. Extra utility of the DRC token, such as being the only medium of exposure to the Digital Reserve Vaults, may increase its value proposition.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How does DRC have an organic deflationary model?",
    answer: [
      "Over time, some DRC tokens most likely will be lost, due to sending errors, etc. Because of that, the total DRC token supply will be decreasing over time. For example, according to a Chainalysis study, about 4 million bitcoins have been already lost and cannot be recovered.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Why is DRC a <em>potential</em> digital store of value?",
    answer: [
      "Currently, DRC does not have all necessary SoV attributes and cannot be compared to gold or Bitcoin because of the low level of its global adoption and short historical performance. DRC is a long-term monetary experiment. A stable growth and global recognition are needed for DRC to become a true store of value.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How is The Lindy Effect applicable to DRC?",
    answer: [
      "The Lindy effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. This concept is applicable to the DRC potential as a digital store of value.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Should I invest in DRC?",
    answer: [
      "It depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, investment timeline, networth, and blockchain market knowledge. It is clearly stated in the DRC White Paper that DRC token value may arise because of the network effect, as more people believe in its intrinsic value and utility. At the same time, DRC token may lose its value if it does not receive global adoption as a digital store of value.",

  {
    question: "What does the DRC logo symbolise?",
    answer: [
      `Those familiar with Norse runes may recognise the DRC logo as ‘Inguz’ or ‘Ing-Rune’. Visually resembling the chain of the human DNA, this letter is symbolic of the ability to bring life into being, to allow growth and accumulate great strength and represents the motto of "Where there is a will, there is a way".`,
